# Marta Bianchini

Hello, I’m Marta, a career‑changer Software Engineer! After a 5-year job as a clinician for the NHS, I decided to give my career a twist and become a software engineer. I was enrolled at Makers Academy, a highly selective and intensive software engineering bootcamp.
Through this experience, I gained a strong foundation in writing clear, adaptable, and testable code.
As my passion for coding is evolving into my new career, I take pride in continuously improving myself as a developer and learning new skills.

## Skills

### Communication

Thanks to the years spent in my clinical career I got the opportunity to develop and enhance my communications skills.
Having the chance to talk daily with my patients (adults and kids) and their parents really taught me how to explain problems, elucidate doubts, handle difficult conversation and, last but not least, how to best engage and relate with people from all the age’s range.
