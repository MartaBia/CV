# Marta Bianchini üë©üèª‚Äçüíª


Hello, I‚Äôm Marta, a career‚Äëchanger Software Engineer! After a 5-year job as a clinician for the NHS, I decided to give my career a twist and become a software engineer. I was enrolled at Makers Academy, a highly selective and intensive software engineering bootcamp.
Through this experience, I gained a strong foundation in writing clear, adaptable, and testable code.
As my passion for coding is evolving into my new career, I take pride in continuously improving myself as a developer and learning new skills.

 ## Soft Skills üë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Communicative
My previous career as a clinician allowed me to develop and enhance my communication skills. Interacting with my patients, both adults and children, as well as their parents and relatives on a daily basis, enabled me to acquire the skillset necessary for conveying complex concepts in a comprehensible manner, clarifying doubts, managing sensitive discussions, and, perhaps most importantly, building rapport and connecting with individuals of all ages.

### Curious
I am driven by a passionate will to learn, try and discover new things. From my job to my next travel destination, I am always looking for something new to do and discover, I love adventure and I am always keen on trying new things and experiences.

### Adaptable
I consider myself to be a very flexible person and over the years, during my clinical career and my bootcamp experience I always proved to be able to adapt to the various situations around me and I always manage to overcome any problem.
