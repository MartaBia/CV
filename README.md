# Marta Bianchini üë©üèª‚Äçüíª


Hello, I‚Äôm Marta, a career‚Äëchanger Software Engineer! After a 5-year job as a clinician for the NHS, I decided to give my career a twist and become a software engineer. I was enrolled at Makers Academy, a highly selective and intensive software engineering bootcamp.
Through this experience, I gained a strong foundation in writing clear, adaptable, and testable code.
As my passion for coding is evolving into my new career, I take pride in continuously improving myself as a developer and learning new skills.

In this job, I continued working as a clinician but I also integrate it with managerial duties.
My duties included the order of clinical supplies, as well as coordinating vision screenings and training School Nurses Assistants.
Managing these additional responsibilities has honed my time management skills, as I have had to efficiently organize and prioritize my workload between clinical duties and managerial tasks. This experience has equipped me with the ability to handle multiple responsibilities, meet deadlines, and ensure smooth operations.

My work in the Stroke Ward and Injection Clinic put me daily in close contact with different colleagues and enabled me to develop effective interaction skills with each of them.
As a tutor for University Orthoptist Students, I had the opportunity to not only develop my communication skills but also share my knowledge and expertise with others. Teaching students allowed me to refine my ability to explain complex concepts and help them improve their own communication skills. Additionally, I guided them in time management techniques and encouraged the adoption of best practices in their learning process.
